# CS-305-Software-Security

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers such as savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They want to use the most current and effective software security for their modernization of operations.

# What did you do very well when you found your client's software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company's overall wellbeing?
After performing the static testing to identify security vulnerabilities, I provided a mitigation plan that addressed the concerning dependencies. If the older versions of Spring Framework and Apache Tomcat weren't required, updated versions should be acquired and the static test repeated. It is important to code securely, especially when maintaining personal and financial information such as Artemis Financial. Compromise of security can negatively effect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. This will lead to costly financial repairs and long-term damage to reputation.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most helpful part of running the vulnerability assessment was using the Dependency Check

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
